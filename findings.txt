Summarise your findings here (see specification).

==================== START OF FINDINGS ===========================

================ Which board is impossible? ======================

Conclusion:
'mystery2' board is impossible. See output of main.cpp

========= Which boards are 'hard' and 'extremely hard'? =======

It is between 'mystery1' or 'mystery3' as 'mystery2' is impossible.

There are a number of tests done to determine which is more difficult.
The results of these are given below, followed by my conclusion.

NOTE ON INTERPRETATION OF THE QUESTION: 
The question assumes the labelling of the boards as 'hard' or 'extremely
hard' refers to the difficult a human player would have solving the boards.

============================ TESTS ================================

================ Given numbers test ==============

The following table shows the number of squares that are pre-filled in each puzzle:

board       given numbers
easy        26
medium      25
mystery1    23
mystery3    24

This suggests that mystery1 is more difficult, and that this may be a reasonable test.

================= Recursive function calls test =============== 

NOTE: THE TESTS THAT PROVIDED THE RESULTS IN THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN
    COMMENTED OUT OF THE SUBMISSION DUE TO THEM CAUSING A COMPILATION
    ERROR ON LABTS

The following table shows the number of calls to the function solve_board needed
to solve each puzzle:

board       recursive calls
easy        2172
medium      15662
mystery1    421547
mystery3    14134   

On one hand, the relative number of calls needed to solve 'easy' and 'medium' boards suggests that this
is a good measure of difficulty. However, the fact that mystery3 is solved in fewer calls than
'medium' strongly suggests otherwise, as 'mystery3' is known to be more difficult than 'medium'.

Therefore no conclusion can be drawn from this result.

================= Recursive backtracks test ================== 

NOTE: THE TESTS THAT PROVIDED THE RESULTS IN THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN
    COMMENTED OUT OF THE SUBMISSION DUE TO THEM CAUSING A COMPILATION
    ERROR ON LABTS

The number of 'backtracks' within the recursive solver was also investigated.
However, this number was found to have a common difference with the number of
function calls so provides no additional insight. The results are given below:

board       backtracks ('return 0s' of solve_board)
easy        2116
medium      15605
mystery1    421488
mystery3    14076

================= 'Possible' or 'Certain' moves tests ================== 

A 'possible' move is defined as whenever a digit can be put into a square.
A 'certain' move is whenever only one digit can go in a square.

A function was written to loop through all empty squares on the board
making a move whenever there was only one possible move in that square
(a 'certain' move).

The following tables show the results:

board       possible moves      certain moves
easy        190                 0
medium      686                 63
mystery1    227                 0
mystery3    222                 0

The results of possible moves investigation indicates that this is not
a reasonable measure, as medium has many more moves than easy, and both
hard boards are in between these values.

The results of the certain moves test is also unusable. Easy has no certain
moves yet is defined as the easiest board. The reason for this is that our
definition of a 'certain' moves only counts certain moves per square. It does
not count certain moves per row, column or 3x3 box. e.g. the case given in
the coursework specification where I8 of 'easy' must contain a '1' because 
a '1' can not go anywhere else in the box. As is shown in the table, this
was not counted and indeed these types of moves are one of the fundamental
moves that even a beginner human player would use.

============================= CONCLUSION ===================================

The only test carried out that produces apparently reliable results - ones
where there is a correlation with the difficulty of the boards easy, medium
and the hard boards - is the basic number of digits already filled in count.

Therefore we must conclude that 'mystery1' is the 'extremely hard' board and 'mystery3'
is the 'hard' board, as 'mystery1' has fewer given numbers than
'mystery3'.
